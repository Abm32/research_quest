## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/research-quest.git
   cd research-quest
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables in `.env`:
   ```
   VITE_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
   VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
   VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_discord_client_secret
   VITE_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=your_slack_bot_token
   VITE_REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_reddit_client_id
   VITE_REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_reddit_client_secret
   ```

4. Create a Firebase project and add your configuration to `src/config/firebase.ts`:
   ```typescript
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "your-api-key",
     authDomain: "your-auth-domain",
     projectId: "your-project-id",
     storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket",
     messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
     appId: "your-app-id"
   };
   ```

5. Deploy Firebase security rules:
   - Copy the contents of `firebase.rules` to your Firebase Console
   - Deploy the rules through the Firebase Console or CLI

6. Create Firestore indexes:
   - Use `firestore.indexes.json` to set up the required indexes
   - Deploy through Firebase Console or CLI

7. Set up Supabase:
   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Run the migrations in `supabase/migrations`
   - Update the environment variables with your Supabase credentials

8. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
